        <h2>Instructions:</h2>
       <ol>
        <li><b>Marinate the Chicken:</b></li>
        <ul>
            <li>In a bowl, mix the chicken pieces with yogurt, ginger-garlic paste, turmeric powder, red chili powder, and salt. Let it marinate for at least 30 minutes.</li>
        </ul>
        <li><b>Prepare the Rice:</b></li>
        <ul>
            <li>Wash the basmati rice thoroughly under running water until the water runs clear. Soak the rice in water for about 30 minutes.</li>
            <li>Bring a large pot of water to boil. Add salt and whole spices (bay leaf, cloves, peppercorns, cinnamon stick). Add the soaked and drained rice to the boiling water.</li>
            <li>Cook the rice until it is 70-80% done (parboiled). Drain the rice and set aside.</li>
        </ul>
        <li><b>Cook the Chicken Masala:</b></li>
        <ul>
            <li>Heat ghee or oil in a large, heavy-bottomed pot over medium heat. Add cumin seeds and let them splutter.</li>
            <li>Add sliced onions and sauté until they turn golden brown.</li>
            <li>Add chopped tomatoes and cook until they turn soft and oil starts to separate.</li>
            <li>Add marinated chicken pieces along with the marinade. Cook on medium-high heat until the chicken is almost cooked through and the masala is well blended.</li>
            <li>Add green chilies, chopped coriander, and mint leaves. Mix well and adjust salt and spices according to your taste.</li>
            <li>Remove half of this chicken masala and set aside.</li>
        </ul>
        <li><b>Layering the Biryani:</b></li>
        <ul>
            <li>In the pot with the remaining chicken masala, spread half of the parboiled rice evenly.</li>
            <li>Sprinkle half of the garam masala powder and drizzle half of the saffron milk (if using).</li>
            <li>Spread the reserved chicken masala over the rice.</li>
            <li>Layer the remaining rice on top and sprinkle the remaining garam masala and saffron milk.</li>
            <li>Cover the pot with a tight-fitting lid. You can also seal the edges of the lid with a dough made of flour to trap the steam (optional).
            </li>
        </ul>
        <li><b>Dum Cooking (Slow Cooking):</b></li>
        <ul>
            <li>Place the pot on very low heat (you can place a tava or griddle under the pot to diffuse heat) and cook for 20-25 minutes. This slow cooking process is known as "dum."</li>
            <li>Alternatively, you can bake the biryani in a preheated oven at 180°C (350°F) for 20-25 minutes.</li>
        </ul>
        <li><b>Serve:</b></li>
        <ul>
            <li>Once done, gently fluff the biryani with a fork.</li>
            <li>Garnish with fried onions, fried cashews, and raisins if desired.</li>
            <li>Serve hot with raita (yogurt salad) and/or your favorite side dish.</li>
        </ul>
       </ol>
