        <h2>Instructions:</h2>
        <ol>
        <li><b>Preparation:</b></li>
        <ul>
        <li>Wash the broken wheat, split Bengal gram, and split red lentils thoroughly under running water. Soak them in water separately for at least 1 hour.</li>
        </ul>
        <li>Cooking the Lentils and Wheat:</li>
        <ul>
        <li>In a large pot, combine the soaked broken wheat, split Bengal gram, and split red lentils with about 6 cups of water.</li>
        <li>Bring to a boil over medium-high heat, then reduce the heat to low and simmer, partially covered, until the lentils and wheat are very tender and well cooked (about 1.5 to 2 hours). Stir occasionally and add more water if necessary to prevent sticking and ensure it doesn't dry out. The mixture should be very soft and mushy..</li>
        </ul>
        <li><b>Prepare the Chicken:</b></li>
        <ul>
        <li>While the lentils and wheat are cooking, heat oil or ghee in a separate pan over medium heat.</li>
        <li>Add sliced onions and sauté until they turn golden brown.</li>
        <li>Add ginger-garlic paste and sauté for another minute until fragrant.</li>
        <li>Add chopped tomatoes and cook until they soften and oil starts to separate.</li>
        <li>Add chicken pieces, turmeric powder, red chili powder, garam masala powder, black pepper, cinnamon, cloves, nutmeg, and salt. Mix well and cook until the chicken is cooked through and tender.</li>
        </ul>
        <li><b>Combine Chicken with Lentil-Wheat Mixture:</b></li>
        <ul>
            <li>Once the lentils and wheat are very soft and mushy, use a hand blender or mash them well with a potato masher to achieve a smooth texture. You can leave some texture if desired..</li>
            <li>Add the cooked chicken mixture to the pot of lentils and wheat. Mix well to combine everything thoroughly.</li>
        </ul>
        <li><b>Simmering Haleem:</b></li>
        <ul>
            <li>Place the pot back on low heat and simmer the haleem, stirring frequently, for another 30-40 minutes. This helps to meld the flavors together and achieve a thicker consistency. Add more water if necessary to reach your desired thickness.</li>
        </ul>
        <li><b>Serve:</b></li>
        <ul>
            <li>Once the haleem reaches the desired consistency, check for seasoning and adjust salt and spices if needed..</li>
            <li>Serve hot, garnished with chopped fresh coriander (cilantro), fried onions (if using), and lemon wedges on the side..</li>
            <li>Haleem is traditionally enjoyed with naan bread or parathas.</li>
        </ul>
